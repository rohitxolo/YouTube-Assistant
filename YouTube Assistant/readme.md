🎥 YouTube Assistant using LangChain 🤖
🌟 Overview


This project is a YouTube Assistant that uses LangChain and Streamlit 🖥️ to provide concise answers to user queries by analyzing YouTube video transcripts 🎞️. It creates a vector database 📚 for efficient similarity search 🔎 and uses AI models 🤖 to respond accurately based on the content of the video.

🚀 Features


📜 Transcript Analysis: Extract and analyze transcripts from YouTube videos.
❓ Interactive Queries: Ask questions based on video content.
🌐 Web Interface: Built with Streamlit for ease of use.
🧠 Semantic Search: Uses FAISS for efficient search over transcript data.
📝 AI-Powered Responses: Integrates OpenAI's LLM models for natural and accurate answers.

🛠️ Project Workflow
🎥 Load a YouTube video's transcript using YoutubeLoader.
✂️ Split the transcript into smaller chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
🧬 Embed the chunks using OpenAIEmbeddings and create a FAISS vector database.
🔎 Perform similarity search to fetch relevant transcript sections based on user queries.
🤖 Process user queries using OpenAI's text-davinci model and return concise, factual responses.
